(a) Download MemoryGame.hpp and MemoryGameClient.cpp from blackboard.
 
(b) Download MemoryGame_partial.cpp and rename it as MemoryGame.cpp. Finish TODO parts. That is,
(b1) Implement swap and randomize functions, which will be used by MemoryGame class but are not member functions of MemoryGame.
(b2) Implement the following member functions and constructor / destructor in MemoryGame.cpp: default constructor, destructor, display, and play.
(c) Upload MemoryGame.hpp and MemoryGame.cpp to gradescope for grading. MemoryGameClient.cpp does not need to be upload to gradescope, but it will be needed to run the code in local computer.
Some students may use online gdb for C++, in that case, delete main.cpp or remove code from default main.cpp to avoid duplicated main functions, then upload MemoryGame.hpp, MemoryGame.cpp, and MemoryGameClient.cpp. Click run button, and the project works.
